# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the Coursera project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

In the current repo you'll find a R script, run_analysis.R. 

It does the following:

1. Download source data
2. Rename columns along project requirements
3. Merge X,Y and subject tables
4. Append train and test data
5. Extract mean and standard deviation columns
6. Creates a tidy table with average values by subjects and activities.

The output file is named avgBy.txt.
